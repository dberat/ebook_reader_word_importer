# Words from Kobo e-book reader

Some e-book readers have a feature that we can highlight and save words from the books we read.

As an avid reader and a non-native English speaker, I add the words that I don't know their meanings to the word list of my Kobo e-book reader. Then I export those words from the reader and study them every now and then to memorise. 

Till now, I used to use another software to export the words, but I wanted to write my own program to export these words since I know programming now!

This program exports the words and writes them into an Excel file. It adds commas after every word as the mobile app I use has a feature to make it easier to add words altogether if they have commas after them. Then I add the meaning of those words and I use that mobile app often to memorise those words.

I tried to use an API key from a dictionary to add the meanings of the words while I am exporting them but as they are all very expensive, I skipped that part for now.

## Installation

There is an `exe` file in the "dist" folder if you would like to use this.

## Usage

When you run the exe file, you will see a window that has 2 input boxes. One is for the name of the book, you should write the name of the book and the other one is the sheet name you want to create in the Excel file. This program creates one Excel file and it adds different sheets for different books every time you run it for different books.

I added a `words.xlsx` file to show you how the words look. These words are from "A Hero of Our Time" by Mikhail Lermontov. I highly recommend it, especially if you like classical literature.
